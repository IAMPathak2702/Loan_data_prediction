## Usage

1. **Organize Your Project**: Ensure your project structure is organized as described above.

2. **Write Your Model Code**: Implement your machine learning model using scikit-learn and save it in a Python file, e.g., `your_model.py`.

3. **Write `setup.py`**: Create a `setup.py` file to define metadata for your package and specify dependencies.

4. **Write README.md**: Provide a README file (`README.md`) describing your package, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant information.

5. **Testing and Documentation**: Ensure your model works as expected and provide clear documentation on how to use it.

6. **Distribution**: To distribute your package, you can upload it to PyPI or other repositories.

## Installation

To install the package locally, navigate to the directory containing `setup.py` and run:

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
